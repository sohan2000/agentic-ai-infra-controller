# UPDATE.md

## Progress Update

### Features Added
1. **S3 Integration**:
   - Integrated AWS S3 to fetch telemetry files based on user queries.
   - Added functionality to retrieve S3 telemetry data for specific time ranges when required.

2. **Enhanced Date Range Extraction**:
   - Updated the `extract_date_range` function to identify whether raw S3 telemetry logs are needed.
   - Added rules to determine if sensor-level data or high-level summaries are requested.

3. **MongoDB Chat Logs**:
   - Implemented logging of user queries and AI responses into the MongoDB `chat_logs` collection.
   - Logs include timestamps, date ranges, and whether S3 data was used.

4. **CORS Middleware**:
   - Added CORS middleware to allow cross-origin requests for the FastAPI server.

5. **Timezone-Aware Datetimes**:
   - Replaced deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` for timezone-aware datetime handling.

6. **Redfish Automation**:
   - Integrated Agentic AI-based automatic Redfish API triggers for enhanced telemetry data collection.

### Challenges Faced
1. **Date Parsing**:
   - Handling ambiguous date formats in user queries required additional logic and testing.
   - Ensuring compatibility with various natural language date expressions.

2. **S3 Data Handling**:
   - Managing large telemetry files from S3 and limiting the response size to avoid performance issues.

3. **Concurrency**:
   - Ensuring the FastAPI server handles concurrent requests efficiently while querying MongoDB and S3.

### Next Steps
1. **UI Integrations**:
   - Integrate the front end with the back end.

2. **Testing**:
   - Conduct extensive testing for edge cases and integrations

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update the README with detailed usage instructions and examples for new features.

### Blockers
- None currently, but further testing may reveal edge cases requiring
