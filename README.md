## Focus Area
*Agentic AI for Autonomous Infrastructure Observability and Control*
- Intelligent monitoring, analysis, and autonomous remediation for data center hardware (with LLM-powered agents).

## Description of the Problem

As data centers scale, traditional infrastructure management tools are increasingly inadequate. While legacy platforms provide monitoring and visualization, they are overwhelmingly reactive, fragmented, and require high manual intervention for fault detection and system recovery. This results in delays, human error, and missed opportunities for optimization.

*Current challenges:*
- Lack of real-time insight and predictive detection for hardware faults.
- Limited (if any) use of intelligent, autonomous agents for controlling hardware or remediating issues.
- Visualization and observability are treated as endpoints, not as enablers for action.

## What We Built

We built an *agentic, AI-powered platform* that couples deep observability with autonomous, intelligent control:
- Hardware telemetry is continuously ingested and analyzed.
- Instead of just dashboards, an LLM-powered agent interprets, reasons, and acts—triggering controls, remediations, or optimizations with minimal human intervention.
- Observability is harnessed as a substrate for proactive, autonomous action—not just monitoring.

### **Axiado Observability Platform – Architecture Overview**

![img](./AxiadoHackathonArchitecture.png)


The architecture integrates multiple components for **hardware telemetry, real-time observability, AI-driven insights, and automated control actions.** Below is a structured explanation:

---

### **1. Redfish API (Mocked Layer)**

* We have **mocked the Redfish API from scratch** to simulate BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) telemetry.
* It provides hardware metrics (e.g., fan speeds, voltages, power limits) and accepts control commands (e.g., adjusting thresholds or turning on/off components).
* This mock Redfish API acts as the **data source** for telemetry.

---

### **2. FastAPI Backend**

* FastAPI **pulls telemetry data** from the Redfish API at regular intervals (Step 1).
* Implements **rule-based signal classification** and stores data batches (Step 2).
* Streams **real-time logs** to the React UI using SSE (Server-Sent Events) or polling (Step 3).
* Exposes `/metrics` endpoints for Prometheus scraping (Step 4).

---

### **3. Prometheus & Grafana**

* **Prometheus** polls the FastAPI `/metrics` endpoint every 5 seconds (Step 4).
* **Grafana** visualizes Prometheus data in real time and renders dashboards (Step 5 & 6).
* **Real-time Grafana dashboards** are embedded into the React UI for seamless monitoring.

---

### **4. MongoDB & S3**

* **MongoDB** stores transactional/historical telemetry data (Step 7).
* **S3** is used for **log archival and snapshot storage** (Step 8).

---

### **5. LangChain + Gemini AI**

* AI uses **LangChain with Gemini** to query both MongoDB and S3 snapshots (Step 9).
* Supports **two query types**:

  1. **Inference Queries** – e.g., “How many telemetry records were captured between two timestamps?”
  2. **Action Queries** – e.g., “Set chassis fan speed to 100%” or “Adjust PSU power threshold.”
* AI responses are conversational, providing contextual explanations.

---

### **6. React Frontend**

* **Chat panel:** Allows natural language queries (inference & action-based).
* **Real-time logs panel:** Displays logs as they stream from the backend.
* **Grafana panel:** Embedded real-time metrics visualization.
* **Query filters:** Enables historical log search (via MongoDB queries).
* Users can ask:

  * *“What telemetry issues arose between July 24 and July 25?”* (inference)
  * *“Set PSU 1 power threshold to 500 watts.”* (action → triggers Redfish endpoints).

---

### **7. Trigger Actions**

* AI can **trigger Redfish control endpoints** through FastAPI (Step 11).
* Example: Adjusting fan speeds, changing voltage thresholds, or power limits.

---

### **Key Highlights**

* **Fully mocked Redfish API** with both telemetry and control.
* **Real-time logs + AI-based conversational interface.**
* **Two types of queries:**

  * Historical data inference from MongoDB/S3.
  * Hardware control via Redfish actions.
* **Prometheus & Grafana embedded in the same React screen** for a unified observability dashboard.

---

### **Future Scope**

1. **Real Hardware Integration**

   * Replace the mocked Redfish API with a **real Redfish + BMC stack**, enabling **vendor-specific control actions** (e.g., power capping, thermal throttling, fan tuning).

2. **Scalable Log Streaming**

   * Introduce **Kafka** (or a Kafka-compatible queue) for distributed log streaming and reliable ingestion, making the system horizontally scalable.

3. **Containerization & Deployment**

   * **Dockerize and containerize** the entire platform and deploy on Kubernetes for fault tolerance and ease of scaling.

4. **Batch & Stream Aggregation**

   * Integrate **Apache Flink** and **Apache Spark** for both **batch and stream processing** of logs and telemetry data, enabling advanced analytics like trend detection and rolling aggregations.

5. **Online Log Querying**

   * Add **real-time querying capabilities via Flink SQL**, integrated directly into the UI for instant, complex queries over streaming logs.

6. **Adaptive Control & Autonomous Agents**

   * While the current setup performs **batch archival**, we will extend it with an **LLM-based agent** that monitors logs, detects anomalies, and **autonomously triggers corrective actions** or **sends alerts**.
